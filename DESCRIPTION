Description: Determine optimal planning that includes the number and type of resources needed to extinguishing a forest fire is a difficult task In this app, a general integer programming model is programed which also includes the allocation of resources to different periods of time in a day embedded in extinguishing a fire, with the goal of meeting the Spanish regulations regarding non-neglect of fronts and periods of rest of the pilots. We consider two types to get a solution, the exact method and also an heuristic algorithm designed specifically for this problem which allows to obtain a quality solution quickly in real problems. Alse we built a Shiny app to solve the problems.
